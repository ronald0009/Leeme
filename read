# Code Review / Refactoring exercise
###### What feedback would you give?
- Do something with the "boolean" value returned by "createNewFile".
```java
logFile.createNewFile();
```
- Use try-with-resources or close this "Connection" in a "finally" clause.
```java
connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:" 
```
- Move this file to a named package.
```java
private boolean initialized;
```
- The return value of "trim" must be used.
```java
messageText.trim();
```
- Use try-with-resources or close this "Statement" in a "finally" clause.
```java
Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
```
- Rename this method name to match the regular expression '^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$'.
- Directly append the argument of String.valueOf().
- Remove this assignment of "logger".
- Static fields should not be updated in constructors.
- Utility classes should not have public constructors.
