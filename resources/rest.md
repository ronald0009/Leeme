# REST API concepts
## Web Services
- Web Services are different pieces of code deployed on different machines and they call methods of each other over the network.
### Web Service Types
There are two types; REST and SOAP Web Services.
#### REST Web Services
- REST web services gives you response data returned in XML/JSON format and there are specific URLs for different operations.
### Web Services Characteristics
- HTTP exchange. Web Services exchange of data happens over the web using HTTP. So the client sends an HTTP request and the server returns back an HTTP response.
- The Protocol. It is the message format for message exchange between the client and the server in a Web Service communication environment.
- Service definition or the service documentation. It's common to have REST Web Services with little to no documentation, because the best REST Web Service doesn't need any documentation.
- REST actually stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
- REST is an architecture style, so REST is a set of guidelines used to guide you in your application architecture.
- We can have kinds of REST Web Services: Not fully RESTful and Completely RESTful.
