## 2.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
- NIST being the National Institute of Standards and Technology
- NIST Cloud Computing definition. The cloud definition, the official cloud definition
  - Starts with on-demand self service. And what that means is that we get what we need, when we need it.
  - We also have broad network access. Meaning that our services have access to a rich collection of networking tools, they have access to the internet, and we can reach them from the internet. 
  - Resource pooling in the definition speaks to the fact that a lot of the systems that we're talking about in cloud computing are shared systems. 
  - The fourth point here is rapid elasticity and what that talks to, what that means is the ability to grow or shrink, on demand. The ability to scale our computing power when we need to. 
  - Typically when we talk about Auto Scaling, we talk about the ability to scale out to meet demand, and scale in to save money. And so we have that very easy ability that we'll talk about later on, to again, add computing power when the demand increases, and remove computing power when that demand decreases. 
- Service models
  - Infrastructure as a service. In many of Amazon's services fall into this category. It is infrastructure that we are buying, it's infrastructure that we're getting on demand, it's infrastructure that we're paying for as we go
  - Platforms as a service generally takes the infrastructure and abstracts the infrastructure away and gives us a tool that we can use to then create software as a service.
  - Software as a service.
- Deployment models we think of
  - Private cloud, that is where a single organization invests their capital into their own data center to build the kinds of technologies that allow for the five points that we talked about: on-demand access, rapid elasticity, things like that. 
  - There's also a community cloud where perhaps several different organizations get together and pool their resources to build a cloud that is used by a small community of organizations. 
  - We also have the public cloud which is what Amazon Web Services is. A public cloud is available for anyone and everyone who can afford to pay their bill. 
  - A hybrid cloud means that we are leveraging something like Amazon Web Services for certain types of either data or computing needs, and also running certain types of computing and storage on premises. We have dedicated private fiber links between those two or VPN connections in order to share data between on premises and Amazon Web Services, a region within AWS.
## 2.2 Business Needs and Cloud Solutions
- Now let's talk about business needs and cloud solutions. When we think about our infrastructure and our applications that run on that infrastructure we could describe our needs fairly succinctly in a few points. 
- First of all, we want resiliency in our infrastructure and our applications. That is to say that we want our applications, we want our infrastructure to mitigate issues as best as possible. 
- We want fault tolerance built in so that our applications can survive and tolerate faults as they come and go. We want our infrastructure to be self-healing to repair that fault automatically. 
- We want any type of an outage to recover as quickly as possible. 
And of course, within Amazon Web Services we have a number of tools to help make that happen as we will talk about. Auto scaling, different data centers that we can choose, we can load balance in different ways. 
- We also want security. We want to allow the right people in, keep the wrong people out. 
And if there is some type of an incident 
- We want tools to be able to monitor to be able to notify us if there's an issue, to help us respond to that issue. And of course, we want tools that allow us to automatically change our rules to help prevent that from happening again. 
- In our infrastructure and applications we also want durability. We want our data to be durable to the point that we don't lose our data. 
For many companies a loss of data would in the least result in perhaps a loss of revenue, a loss of customer satisfaction, customer trust, customer loyalty. It could result in a loss of market share. And for some businesses, some of the clients that I've worked with, the data is the business. If they lost the data they would lose their business. So we want an easy way and a cost effective way to maintain multiple copies of our data and make it easy to back that data up, not just a local backup, but also a geographically diverse backup as well. 
- We want our applications to be performant. We want our end users to have a good experience, to get what they are after as quickly as possible. 
We don't want our end users experiencing lag and delays. Those kinds of things, as studies have shown, will result in a loss of conversion, a loss of revenue and so on. So if our application is not performing very well that could have detrimental impacts on our bottom line. And of course, one of the big reasons that many organizations are moving to Amazon Web Services is for the cost-effectiveness. 
- We want to save money
, right? So, going back to what we talked about earlier with on-demand, with pay-as-you-go, when you get what you need when you need it pay for what you use, if you turn that machine off now you're longer paying for it. If you delete that storage now you're longer paying for it. So there are a number of tools within Amazon Web Services that can help us control costs in all of these things we will continue to talk about as the course progresses. 
- We also want scalability. You can imagine that if today we're seeing a million more visitors than we were yesterday
, then we could very well experience a significant rise in demand, which without the ability to scale could result in down time or at least for some of our end users it could result in their inability to get what they're after. So if an application can't scale to meet that demand then it may very well suffer some down time. And that's exactly what we want to avoid. 
- So scalability, the ability to meet that demand when we have it, and then of course, the ability to scale back down, the ability to save money when we don't have that demand is also an important consideration and an important ability. 
Lastly, 
- we want as many of these things to be automated as possible. 
- Automation is also critical to leveraging the full power of Amazon Web Services. When we automate we remove the human error factor. When we automate we make things more secure and more efficient and that gives rise to a level of agility and flexibility that we've never had before. In terms of our process and our workflow, the way that our teams work, the way that our teams actually get to Amazon and make use of it, first of all, we want our team to be agile. We want the ability to change direction and adapt to the market. We want to adapt to the needs of our team and to the needs of the business. We also want our infrastructure to be flexible. We want to be able to change our minds as our needs change. When we think about traditional on-premises IT a lot of the decisions that we make, many, if not most, of those decisions result in long-term commitments and decisions that cannot be changed for another two to five years, sometimes longer. If you think about doing budget refreshes or hardware refreshes and then budget planning for that, then you will know that when you make a decision to buy certain pieces of hardware and put them in the rack in your own data center, you're gonna keep that particular piece of hardware for quite some time, like I said, two years, five years, maybe longer. And if your needs change now what do you do? If you decide that a different type of architecture could solve that problem better now what do you do? You've already made that decision. You've already spent that money. So traditional on-premises IT is much more hardened rather than flexible. By moving to AWS we gain that ability, that level of flexibility and agility that we've never had before, a level of agility and flexibility that was never possible before. We also want this process and workflow to be efficient. If you imagine, I'm sure many of us are familiar, with ticket-based systems where development teams may submit a ticket to operations and then wait, sometimes weeks in order to get back what they asked for. That's not very efficient. Developers can move at a very significant pace if you give them the tools and the ability to do so. And in fact, most development teams, most engineers, that's what makes them the happiest. When you give them what they need and allow them to move at their pace, that's how you can keep the morale of your team high. When you hamstring them and you prevent them from moving at that pace, when you tell them to wait, that's what will bring morale down. So within Amazon Web Services we have a number of tools that can allow our teams to move at a much more rapid pace, a much efficient process. Instead of developers submitting tickets to operations, and then waiting weeks on end to get something back, we have tools that can allow our development teams to get what they need when they need it and have those types of processes pre-vetted and pre-verified and pre-configured perhaps by operations. So again, we have a number of tools within Amazon Web Services that give us and allow us to build an agile and flexible, and very efficient workflow for deploying applications into the cloud. We also want this process to be secure. We want to follow the principle of least privilege. We want to give our development teams, our operation teams, the proper credentials. We want to enable certain things like federation. We want to allow third-parties, be it vendors or clients, access in certain ways. And we have a number of tools within AWS to allow us to keep our deployment processes and our operational processes secure as we go. From a business perspective, executives, high-level business decision makers, rest well at night knowing that our applications and our data reside in a secure and reliable data center. We want to know that the infrastructure and the data center that is powering our applications is reliable, that we can count on that provider to keep it running and to keep it secure. And Amazon Web Services is indeed a partner like that, that we can rely on and as we go through this course we will uncover and reveal all of the reasons why that statement is true. We also want to keep our capital expenditures low. We want to keep more money in our pocket so that we can invest in other things as time goes on. So as our needs change we have the capital to address that. We also want to avoid long-term commitments. Long-term commitments tend to harden our decisions. They make it more difficult for us to change our mind and adapt when our needs change. Amazon Web Services solves all of these. AWS gives us that secure and reliable data center. They allow us to pay for what we use, use what we need and pay for what we use, giving us lowering our capital expenditures and changing our costs from high CapEx to smaller variable costs, and they allow us to use what we need with no long-term commitments allowing us to change our minds at any time as our needs change. We also want a fast time to market. When we have a new feature for an existing service, when we have a new service all together, we want to deliver that to the market as quickly as possible and allow the market to prove whether or not they find that feature or service valuable. If not, we can go back, try something else, get that to the market. If they do like it, we can find ways to improve it, and get those improvements to the market fast. By doing that we can potentially be competitors to the market. We can keep our end users happy and satisfied that we are giving them things that add value to the application or service that they're paying for. So when we look at the big picture these are the needs in the market that Amazon Web Services is addressing. These are the challenges that a number of organizations are facing and this is how we're solving them. As we go through this course we will get more into these topics and look more closely at the cloud value proposition as to how Amazon solve these and allows our business to capitalize on these to save money, to gain a level of agility and flexibility that we've never had before, and really see the value and realize the value of cloud computing.
