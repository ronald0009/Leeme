## 2.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
- NIST being the National Institute of Standards and Technology
- NIST Cloud Computing definition. The cloud definition, the official cloud definition, starts with on-demand self service. And what that means is that we get what we need, when we need it.
- We also have broad network access. Meaning that our services have access to a rich collection of networking tools, they have access to the internet, and we can reach them from the internet. Resource pooling in the definition speaks to the fact that a lot of the systems that we're talking about in cloud computing are shared systems. 
- Now, it is possible in some cases, to get virtual machines or even bare metal machines that are dedicated to you as a customer, that are a single-tenant environment. But when you zoom out, and you look at the big picture, you'll see that sometimes in a case of virtual machines, the physical host is a multi-tenant environment, the rack that that physical host sits in, the switch that it's behind on a networking level, the building, the power, the cooling, and so on. These are all shared across numerous customers. Right so, resource pooling, is how a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, can offer the services that they do at the prices that they do. 
- The fourth point here is rapid elasticity and what that talks to, what that means is the ability to grow or shrink, on demand. The ability to scale our computing power when we need to. Typically when we talk about Auto Scaling, we talk about the ability to scale out to meet demand, and scale in to save money. And so we have that very easy ability that we'll talk about later on, to again, add computing power when the demand increases, and remove computing power when that demand decreases. 
- Service models
  - Infrastructure as a service. In many of Amazon's services fall into this category. It is infrastructure that we are buying, it's infrastructure that we're getting on demand, it's infrastructure that we're paying for as we go
  - Platforms as a service generally takes the infrastructure and abstracts the infrastructure away and gives us a tool that we can use to then create software as a service. Some of Amazon's products fall into that category as well.
  - Software as a service
- Deployment models we think of
  - Private cloud, that is where a single organization invests their capital into their own data center to build the kinds of technologies that allow for the five points that we talked about: on-demand access, rapid elasticity, things like that. 
  - There's also a community cloud where perhaps several different organizations get together and pool their resources to build a cloud that is used by a small community of organizations. 
  - We also have the public cloud which is what Amazon Web Services is. A public cloud is available for anyone and everyone who can afford to pay their bill. 
  - A hybrid cloud means that we are leveraging something like Amazon Web Services for certain types of either data or computing needs, and also running certain types of computing and storage on premises. We have dedicated private fiber links between those two or VPN connections in order to share data between on premises and Amazon Web Services, a region within AWS.
