## 2.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cloud Computing definition:
  - On-demand self service. And what that means is that we get what we need, when we need it.
  - Broad network access. Meaning that our services have access to a rich collection of networking tools, they have access to the internet, and we can reach them from the internet. 
  - Resource pooling speaks to the fact that a lot of the systems that we're talking about in cloud computing are shared systems. 
  - Rapid elasticity, we talk about the ability to scale out to meet demand, and scale in to save money.
- Service models
  - Infrastructure as a service.
  - Platforms as a service.
  - Software as a service.
- Deployment models
  - Private cloud, that is where a single organization invests their capital into their own data center to build the kinds of technologies that allow for the five points that we talked about: on-demand access, rapid elasticity, things like that. 
  - There's also a community cloud where perhaps several different organizations get together and pool their resources to build a cloud that is used by a small community of organizations. 
  - We also have the public cloud which is what Amazon Web Services is. 
  - A hybrid cloud means that we are leveraging something like Amazon Web Services for certain types of either data or computing needs, and also running certain types of computing and storage on premises. We have dedicated private fiber links between those two or VPN connections in order to share data between on premises and Amazon Web Services, a region within AWS.
## 2.2 Business Needs and Cloud Solutions
- We want resiliency in our infrastructure and our applications. That is to say that we want our applications, we want our infrastructure to mitigate issues as best as possible. 
- We want fault tolerance built in so that our applications can survive and tolerate faults as they come and go. We want our infrastructure to be self-healing to repair that fault automatically. 
- We want any type of an outage to recover as quickly as possible. 
- We also want security. We want to allow the right people in, keep the wrong people out. 
- We want tools to be able to monitor to be able to notify us if there's an issue, to help us respond to that issue. 
- We want tools that allow us to automatically change our rules to help prevent that from happening again. 
- We also want durability. We want our data to be durable to the point that we don't lose our data. 
- We want our applications to be performant. We want our end users to have a good experience, to get what they are after as quickly as possible. 
- We want to save money.
- We also want scalability, the ability to meet that demand when we have it, and then of course, the ability to scale back down, the ability to save money when we don't have that demand is also an important consideration and an important ability. 
- Lastly, we want as many of these things to be automated as possible. 
## 2.3 Overview of Amazon Web Services
- AWS, ultimately, is a very rich collection of services that solve just about any type of use case you can imagine. AWS gives us a collection of services dedicated to computing, such as virtual machines, serverless computing, containerized computing. We have services dedicated to block storage, object storage, and archival storage. We have services dedicated to application notifications such as just simple notifications, emails, queues, and so on. AWS also gives us a very rich collection of data stores from relational databases, to NoSQL databases, and memory caches, and more. We also have services dedicated to analytics allowing us to perform real-time analytics on streaming data to allow us to index and search vast data sets. We can also create and leverage services that allow us to perform ad hoc queries on petabyte scale or even exabyte-sized data sets. AWS also gives us a number of tools to allow us to create and manage a very secure network for our applications running in the cloud. We also have a number of tools that allow us to manage our deployment processes from code repos, to build servers, to code pipelines, and a number of other tools that can help us automate the creation and ongoing management of infrastructure within AWS. 
## 2.4 AWS Cloud Value Proposition
- Now let's take a look at the AWS Cloud value proposition. First let's talk about what AWS provides. 
- AWS provides, On-Demand resources. That means to get what you need when you need it. 
- It gives rise to scalability, it gives rise to self-healing and so on, it gives rise to a level of resilience and a fault-tolerance and flexibility and agility. All of these good things are made possible by the On-Demand nature of AWS. 
- Amazon also gives us the pay as you go billing model. 
- Amazon also gives no long-term commitments, which means that we are free to throw things away. That gives us the ability to save money by tearing down things when we no longer need them. It also gives us the ability to turn things off when we no longer need them. When you think about dev and test environments, they're not typically running on nights, weekends, holidays and so on. So, by turning those things off we can save money. 
- And we also have within AWS a very highly automated ecosystem; the ability to repeat these things, right? So when you think about different types of infrastructure architectures that need to be repeated, perhaps you repeat an architecture in different environments; dev, test, QA, production. 
- And then of course AWS also provides a number of managed services, but managed services typically have inherent high availability, fault-tolerance, security, durability, and so on by leveraging managed services. 
- We can gain a level of flexibility and agility that was never possible with traditional on-premises IT. 
- We can gain an immediate scalability. I have heard first hand accounts from organizations who their on-premises data center was literally wall to wall, floor to ceiling out of room. They had absolutely, on both physical and virtual layers they had no ability to scale several applications, and so by expanding into AWS they gained an ability to scale that they never had before or at least that was not possible in their current situation with on-premises IT. 
- Like we've mentioned we have a lower time to market. All of theses things put together allow us to turn projects that may take months or longer with traditional IT into weeks. Imagine if you could measure your mean time between deployments in hours or minutes. So many organizations that I've been to and taught classes at or consulted with say that many of their applications are deployed on the order of weeks or months, sometimes years. 
- But all of these tools that we're going to talk about through this course, we will see just how we can, we will start to understand how we can lower that time to days or even hours. 
- We can also lower our variable costs, we can lower our upfront costs, and we benefit by easier cost allocation. With traditional on-premises IT, it becomes a challenge to know how our money is being spent by different applications, by different projects, by different teams, environments, cost centers, and so on. If you spend millions of dollars for a particular set of hardware and that particular, you know, set of hardware is being used by numerous teams across numerous environments, it's a challenge to try to allocate well who is responsible for what percentage of those costs? But with AWS, as we will see more in more detail later, we have a very easy way of seeing exactly, down to the penny, no guessing, no estimations, but an exact account. We spent this much money for virtual machines for this project in this environment and so on. 
- And then lastly, one potential benefit is that we can stop running data centers. 
- Numerous organizations have closed many data centers, sometimes cutting their data center footprint in half or more simply by moving, you know, many workloads and datasets into AWS. And for anyone who has been involved in running, you know, your own data center, you will know just how expensive that is, not just in the upfront price, the capital expenditure is enormous, but also the ongoing maintenance of that. When you include power and cooling, when you include leasing the building, when you think about the teams of people that you have to pay to maintain that; network engineers, security guards, and so on, it's an enormous cost, and so by moving applications to AWS, we can realize cost savings at that level, at the physical level, enormous cost savings in that regard. Right, so you can see here that Amazon gives us a lot of tools, a lot of ways that we can improve our current processes, and we benefit in a number of very, very important ways.
