## 2.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cloud Computing definition:
  - On-demand self service. And what that means is that we get what we need, when we need it.
  - Broad network access. Meaning that our services have access to a rich collection of networking tools, they have access to the internet, and we can reach them from the internet. 
  - Resource pooling speaks to the fact that a lot of the systems that we're talking about in cloud computing are shared systems. 
  - Rapid elasticity, we talk about the ability to scale out to meet demand, and scale in to save money.
- Service models
  - Infrastructure as a service.
  - Platforms as a service.
  - Software as a service.
- Deployment models
  - Private cloud, that is where a single organization invests their capital into their own data center to build the kinds of technologies that allow for the five points that we talked about: on-demand access, rapid elasticity, things like that. 
  - There's also a community cloud where perhaps several different organizations get together and pool their resources to build a cloud that is used by a small community of organizations. 
  - We also have the public cloud which is what Amazon Web Services is. 
  - A hybrid cloud means that we are leveraging something like Amazon Web Services for certain types of either data or computing needs, and also running certain types of computing and storage on premises. We have dedicated private fiber links between those two or VPN connections in order to share data between on premises and Amazon Web Services, a region within AWS.
## 2.2 Business Needs and Cloud Solutions
- We want resiliency in our infrastructure and our applications. That is to say that we want our applications, we want our infrastructure to mitigate issues as best as possible. 
- We want fault tolerance built in so that our applications can survive and tolerate faults as they come and go. We want our infrastructure to be self-healing to repair that fault automatically. 
- We want any type of an outage to recover as quickly as possible. 
- We also want security. We want to allow the right people in, keep the wrong people out. 
- We want tools to be able to monitor to be able to notify us if there's an issue, to help us respond to that issue. 
- We want tools that allow us to automatically change our rules to help prevent that from happening again. 
- We also want durability. We want our data to be durable to the point that we don't lose our data. 
- We want our applications to be performant. We want our end users to have a good experience, to get what they are after as quickly as possible. 
- We want to save money.
- We also want scalability, the ability to meet that demand when we have it, and then of course, the ability to scale back down, the ability to save money when we don't have that demand is also an important consideration and an important ability. 
- Lastly, we want as many of these things to be automated as possible. 
## 2.3 Overview of Amazon Web Services
- AWS, ultimately, is a very rich collection of services that solve just about any type of use case you can imagine. AWS gives us a collection of services dedicated to computing, such as virtual machines, serverless computing, containerized computing. We have services dedicated to block storage, object storage, and archival storage. We have services dedicated to application notifications such as just simple notifications, emails, queues, and so on. AWS also gives us a very rich collection of data stores from relational databases, to NoSQL databases, and memory caches, and more. We also have services dedicated to analytics allowing us to perform real-time analytics on streaming data to allow us to index and search vast data sets. We can also create and leverage services that allow us to perform ad hoc queries on petabyte scale or even exabyte-sized data sets. AWS also gives us a number of tools to allow us to create and manage a very secure network for our applications running in the cloud. We also have a number of tools that allow us to manage our deployment processes from code repos, to build servers, to code pipelines, and a number of other tools that can help us automate the creation and ongoing management of infrastructure within AWS. 
## 2.4 AWS Cloud Value Proposition
- AWS provides, On-Demand resources. That means to get what you need when you need it. 
- It gives rise to scalability, it gives rise to self-healing and so on, it gives rise to a level of resilience and a fault-tolerance and flexibility and agility. All of these good things are made possible by the On-Demand nature of AWS. 
- Amazon also gives us the pay as you go billing model. 
- Amazon also gives no long-term commitments, which means that we are free to throw things away. 
- And we also have within AWS a very highly automated ecosystem; the ability to repeat these things, right? So when you think about different types of infrastructure architectures that need to be repeated, perhaps you repeat an architecture in different environments; dev, test, QA, production. 
- And then of course AWS also provides a number of managed services, but managed services typically have inherent high availability, fault-tolerance, security, durability, and so on by leveraging managed services. 
- We can gain a level of flexibility and agility that was never possible with traditional on-premises IT. 
- We can gain an immediate scalability. I have heard first hand accounts from organizations who their on-premises data center was literally wall to wall, floor to ceiling out of room. They had absolutely, on both physical and virtual layers they had no ability to scale several applications, and so by expanding into AWS they gained an ability to scale that they never had before or at least that was not possible in their current situation with on-premises IT. 
- Like we've mentioned we have a lower time to market. All of theses things put together allow us to turn projects that may take months or longer with traditional IT into weeks. Imagine if you could measure your mean time between deployments in hours or minutes. 
- But all of these tools that we're going to talk about through this course, we will see just how we can, we will start to understand how we can lower that time to days or even hours. 
- We can also lower our variable costs, we can lower our upfront costs, and we benefit by easier cost allocation. With traditional on-premises IT, it becomes a challenge to know how our money is being spent by different applications.
- And then lastly, one potential benefit is that we can stop running data centers. 
## Module 2: introduction
### Learning objectives
#### 3.1 AWS Global Infrastructure
- Now let's review the AWS global infrastructure. First, let's take a look at regions. Regions are the primary building block of infrastructure running in AWS. And, if we look at a world map here, we'll see starting from the west coast of the U.S. we have the Oregon region, California, GovCloud West. Moving towards the east coast we have Ohio, Virginia, we have Canada Central, we have Sao Paulo down in South America. Moving into Europe we have Ireland, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Germany. Moving into APAC we have Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Australia. We also have Ningxia, China, Beijing, China, we have Seoul, South Korea, and Tokyo, Japan. And as of the time of this video these regions currently exist and are available for use. By the end of 2018 we will see the launch of four new regions. Those would be GovCloud East, Sweden, Bahrain there in the Middle East, and Hong Kong, and again, regions are the primary location where we would choose to store our data or run our applications. Now, a number of considerations would go into choosing a region. First of all we might consider the available services and features there. Keep in mind that not every region has every service, and there may be features of a particular service missing from certain regions. When Amazon releases new features or new services, they will often do so starting with one or two regions, allow that service or feature to exist in a preview mode before making it generally available to every region. So, if you are looking for a particular feature or service, be sure to check the AWS documentation and choose the region where that particular feature or service is available We should also consider the cost of services. Different services, the cost of that service will vary according to regions. Now, within the U.S., the U.S. regions are all typically the same price. When you leave the U.S. and you move on to places like South America, or Europe, or Asia-Pacific, prices per service will change. So, if you don't have a need to run that particular application in a region close to your end-users, if you're not necessarily serving end-users and trying to provide, you know, good latency, if you're not trying to conform to data compliance and sovereignty laws then you may have the freedom in a particular application to choose a region just because it's less expensive. And then, of course, one very common reason to choose one region over another would be its proximity to your end-users. By choosing a region that's close to your audience, you will provide them with a lower latency, thereby, a better experience. And then, of course, we have disaster recovery. You may choose to run multiple regions for the sake of DR. We may need to consider security and compliance. Keep in mind that different countries have different laws regarding the sovereignty of data, and whether or not certain types of data can leave that region. And as a customer, it is our responsibility to be aware of those local laws, to be aware of the laws that govern us in our business and our data and to make choices, you know, that satisfy that. Now within a particular region we have what we call availability zones. Here, looking at the U.S. west two region, the Oregon region, we have three availability zones. U.S. west two A, two B, and two C. These availability zones are analogous to collections of data centers. Each availability zone is at least one, sometimes maybe two or more data centers that are very, very close together, and each availability zone is spread out, you know, considering fault lines, flood planes, power grids, and so on. These availability zones are also connected with private fiber, allowing Amazon to achieve a very, very low latency with a very large degree of bandwidth between these availability zones. Amazon gives us this as a way to add a further degree of high availability and fall tolerance. As we continue through this course we will see just how we can leverage these availability zones to be resilient to the loss of not only a device, but also to the loss of a data center. So keep that in mind, when you think of availability zones, think of having access to multiple data centers spread apart. When you think of high availability and fall tolerance we should also be thinking in terms of leveraging multiple availability zones. Now let's talk about edge locations. Edge locations power several different things within AWS, namely the content delivery network and D and S. Now as of the time of this video, we do have more than 100 edge locations worldwide. You will see that there is a significant global footprint of edge locations, and you will also notice that many of these reside outside of an AWS region. Now, it's important to understand that these edge locations power, again, content delivery services and D and S. We don't have direct access to the edge location like we do a region. We can generally choose large groups of edge locations, like North America, South America, Europe and so on, but we don't have any direct access to the edge location itself. The benefit of an edge location is that, in the case of content delivery, we can leverage the caching behavior of that edge location. So, let's say that we have an application running in Virginia, and we have an audience in Europe. Content delivery networks can help, in that instead of forcing our European audience to traverse the Atlantic ocean every time for every request, which would introduce latency, which would degrade their experience, we could leverage the content delivery network, leverage those edge locations, so that the content can be cached in edge locations closer to our audience. Again, so when we think about delivering content, improving end-user performance, when we think about leveraging content delivery networks, when we think about leveraging a globally distributed D and S system, that's what edge locations are for.
