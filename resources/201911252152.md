## 2.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cloud Computing definition:
  - On-demand self service. And what that means is that we get what we need, when we need it.
  - Broad network access. Meaning that our services have access to a rich collection of networking tools, they have access to the internet, and we can reach them from the internet. 
  - Resource pooling speaks to the fact that a lot of the systems that we're talking about in cloud computing are shared systems. 
  - Rapid elasticity, we talk about the ability to scale out to meet demand, and scale in to save money.
- Service models
  - Infrastructure as a service.
  - Platforms as a service.
  - Software as a service.
- Deployment models
  - Private cloud, that is where a single organization invests their capital into their own data center to build the kinds of technologies that allow for the five points that we talked about: on-demand access, rapid elasticity, things like that. 
  - There's also a community cloud where perhaps several different organizations get together and pool their resources to build a cloud that is used by a small community of organizations. 
  - We also have the public cloud which is what Amazon Web Services is. 
  - A hybrid cloud means that we are leveraging something like Amazon Web Services for certain types of either data or computing needs, and also running certain types of computing and storage on premises. We have dedicated private fiber links between those two or VPN connections in order to share data between on premises and Amazon Web Services, a region within AWS.
## 2.2 Business Needs and Cloud Solutions
- We want resiliency in our infrastructure and our applications. That is to say that we want our applications, we want our infrastructure to mitigate issues as best as possible. 
- We want fault tolerance built in so that our applications can survive and tolerate faults as they come and go. We want our infrastructure to be self-healing to repair that fault automatically. 
- We want any type of an outage to recover as quickly as possible. 
- We also want security. We want to allow the right people in, keep the wrong people out. 
- We want tools to be able to monitor to be able to notify us if there's an issue, to help us respond to that issue. 
- We want tools that allow us to automatically change our rules to help prevent that from happening again. 
- We also want durability. We want our data to be durable to the point that we don't lose our data. 
- We want our applications to be performant. We want our end users to have a good experience, to get what they are after as quickly as possible. 
- We want to save money.
- We also want scalability, the ability to meet that demand when we have it, and then of course, the ability to scale back down, the ability to save money when we don't have that demand is also an important consideration and an important ability. 
- Lastly, we want as many of these things to be automated as possible.
