# Values-based leadership
1. Self-reflection
2. Balance
3. True Self-Confidence
4. Genuine Humility
## Self-reflection
Daily practice using questions such as:
- What did I say I would do today?
- What am I proud of, and not proud of?
- How did I lead others and follow others?
- If I had today to do over again, what would I change?
- If I am fortunate to have tomorrow, given that what I've learned today, how will I act?
