# OpenShift

OpenShift automates the build, deployment, and management of applications.

The goal of OpenShift is to provide a great experience for both Developers and System Administrators to develop, deploy, and run containerized applications.

## CLI

The OpenShift CLI is accessed using the command oc. From here, you can administrate the entire OpenShift cluster and deploy new applications.

```
$ oc login
$ oc whoami
```

### In the web console, what is a project?

It's a visualization of the Kubernetes namespace based on the developer access controls.
