SNDRCVF The Send/Receive File (SNDRCVF) command is used by a CL program or ILE CL procedure to send data to and receive data from a device that is being used interactively by a user.
The Override with Printer File (OVRPRTF) command is used to (1) override (replace) the file named in the program, (2) override certain parameters of a file that are used by the program, or (3) override the file named in the program and override certain parameters of the file processed.
The Delete Override (DLTOVR) command deletes one or more file overrides (including message file overrides) that were previously specified in a call level. For each overridden file named in the DLTOVR command, the override specified in the same call level as the DLTOVR command is deleted.

The CHAIN operation retrieves a record from a full procedural file (F in position 18 of the file description specifications), sets a record identifying indicator on (if specified on the input specifications), and places the data from the record into the input fields.
The DUMP operation provides a dump (all fields, all files, indicators, data structures, arrays, and tables defined) of the module.
